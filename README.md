# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

My motivation for this project came from the end goal in mind. I want to learn and understand coding so that I can apply the knowledge to my everyday life. I built this project to remind myself of the key topics when using HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. This project guided me through the basics of the modules and provided practical application to the topics.
